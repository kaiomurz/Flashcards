# Flashcards
This is a web-app designed to use flashcards for memorising Mandarin characters. To run, simply:
- clone the project
- create a virtual environment using requirements.txt
- in the command line, in the project folder type in  
    ```export FLASK_APP=flashcards_webapp``` and  
    ```flask run``` and then
- follow the localhost link.  

You will see app in the browser. 
- the default setting is for the flashcards to be in Mandarin and then reveal the English translation when flipped. If you want to see them in English first and then flip to Mandarin, please check the 'E2C' box.
- If you want to limit the number flashcards shown, please type that into the box next to E2C. 
- Them, simply press 'Start'.

After showing you all the flashcards, the app will keep showing you the ones that you got incorrect until you get all of them right.
